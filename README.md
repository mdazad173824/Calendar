Project Description:

This C++ program is designed to create a simple calendar for a specified year. It allows the user to input a year, and then generates a calendar displaying each month with the corresponding days of the week. The program takes into account leap years and adjusts the number of days in February accordingly.

Technology Used:

Programming Language: C++
Standard Library: Standard Template Library (STL) for string and vector manipulation.
Input/Output Handling: Standard Input/Output functions (printf and scanf).

Features:

Year Input:

The user is prompted to input a specific year.
Leap Year Handling:

The program checks if the entered year is a leap year, adjusting the number of days in February accordingly.
Day Calculation:

The first day of the year is calculated to properly align the days of the week in the calendar.
Month Display:

The calendar is displayed month-wise, showing the days of the week in a formatted manner.
User Interface:

Simple console-based interface providing a clear and organized view of the calendar.
